# Create a Tableau story
This is Udacity final project where I have created a visualization of baseball players data provided by Udacity using Tableau.

Here is the initial story version:

The feedback I have received:
1. The story should have a short summary
2. There are missing labels on some of the axis
3. Add more visualizations
4. Change title

version 2:

Feedback for version 2
1. Some charts do not have titles
2. Increase size of commentary captions
3. Avoid using abbreviations on hover or as axis labels
4. Add more interactive elements such as filters or hover tools

Final version

## Design
I have selected several bar charts where I compare left and right handed players performance. I have chosen bar charts as it best represents handedness split into 3 groups. Then I have added handedness filters on almost all sheets. Where there was height or weight data shown I have added range filter so that user can easily filter out height or weight or outliers if any. I've added a title to all sheet and dashboards and also replaced abbreviation to better communicate data to the user as per feedback from the latest review.
For bar charts that focus on the handedness of players, I've chosen a different colour to visually separate from charts that focus on height or weight.

## Summary
While making this story, various Tableau techniques were used to create the different visualization to better represent Baseball data. I have created new columns to help better visualize the relationship between different variables

In conclusion, I found that players weighing approximately 180 or 195 pounds and having height around 72 or 73 inches perform better than other players under the same conditions.
