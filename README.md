# Create a Tableau story
This is Udacity final project where I have created a visualization of baseball players data provided by Udacity using Tableau.

Here is the initial story version:

The feedback I have received:
1. The story should have a short summary
2. There are missing labels on some of the axis
3. Add more visualizations
4. Change title

Final version:

## Summary
While making this story, various Tableau techniques were used to create the different visualization to better represent Baseball data. I have created new columns to help better visualize the relationship between different variables

In conclusion, I found that players weighing approximately 180 or 195 pounds and having height around 72 or 73 inches perform better than other players under the same conditions.
